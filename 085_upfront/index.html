              I wanted to see Norway since childhood when I saw a stylish house
              right in the middle of the Norwegian forest in some magazine. I
              thought then that I also want to live in such a house. This dream
              came true a few months ago on a tour of Norway. I am very happy!
              Thanks, guys!

              We went on this tour with our daughter, she was 5 years old. I was
              worried that it would be difficult for her but everything went
              great. We spent nights in good hotels with excellent breakfasts.
              My daughter always had something to eat, and the nature in Norway
              fascinated her even more than us!

              I still can't believe I have seen the Northern Lights with my own
              eyes! That was incredible! When we arrived in Tromsø, it was
              constantly snowing, the weather was bad, and the guide said that
              we were out of luck, most likely. But on the last night, right at
              midnight, the clouds left, and I saw it! It was magical!
